Welcome to my website! Here I rant about various topics, mainly [technology](/tech/).

It's automatically generated with a [Python program](https://github.com/darkerbit/darkerbit.github.io) that takes in a bunch of markdown files
and turns them into HTML.

This website does not require JavaScript.

It does use it to do local timezone conversion but it isn't required,
and if you don't have JS the times are simply displayed in UTC.

## What's on this website?

### [Technology](/tech/): Me ranting about how all technology kinda sucks actually

---

## Who am I anyway?

I'm darkerbit. I am a Finnish programmer and electronics student who enjoys cobbling together things like this in my spare time.

My favourite [Doctor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Who) is Patrick Troughton.

## Some things I've worked on

- [Quilt Loading Screen](https://modrinth.com/mod/quilt-loading-screen) (now owned by another person but I created it originally, you can see my name in [the license file](https://github.com/emmods/quilt_loading_screen/blob/1.19/LICENSE)).
- [omoribot](https://github.com/darkerbit/omoribot3), a Discord bot that creates OMORI-styled textboxes.

Most of my work isn't public so my GitHub is rather... barren at present :P
